# Cycling-Data
This repository contains code to retrieve bike counter and bike share trip data from various cities across North America and Europe. Additionally, CSV files of aggregated counter and trip data will be provided. Currently this repository is a work in progress.

## Bike Share Data
Bike share data is retrived from the individual provider's website in CSV format. Each of the monthly (or quarterly) CSV files contain data on individual trips. The python files aggregates this data into daily trip counts but can easily be modified for different aggregation windows. Below are the links to each city's bike share system data:
